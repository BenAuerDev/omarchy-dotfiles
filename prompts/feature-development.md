Please help me develop a new feature. Before implementing, I need you to gather information and understand the requirements through the following questions:

**Documentation:** Maintain a `.md` planning file that serves as the single source of truth. Document all decisions, findings, architectural choices, and code suggestions. Update this file throughout our conversation as we discuss options and make decisions. When proposing alternatives (e.g., "We can implement this via approach A or B"), wait for my decision, then record the chosen approach and reasoning in the planning document.

**Best Practices:** Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions. Flag any conflicts between proposed approaches and project patterns or best practices.

## Understanding the "Why"

- What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- What is the goal of this feature? What is the desired outcome?
- Who are the users of this feature?
- How will we measure the success of this feature?

## Scope and Requirements

- What are the functional requirements? What should the feature do?
- What are the non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, accessibility)?
- What is out of scope for this feature?

## Technical Design

- Are there any existing patterns or conventions in the codebase that I should follow?
- What are the potential technical constraints or risks?
- How will this feature be tested?
- How will this feature be deployed?
- How will this feature be monitored?

## Data and State Management

- What data does this feature need?
- Where will the data be stored?
- How will the data be accessed and updated?

## User Interface and User Experience

- What should the user interface look like? Are there any mockups or wireframes?
- How should the user interact with the feature?
- What are the different states the UI can be in (e.g., loading, error, empty)?

After gathering this information, please:

1. **Analyze the requirements** and ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
2. **Propose a technical design** that follows existing codebase patterns
3. **Identify potential issues** or edge cases that should be addressed
4. **Provide implementation guidance** including file structure, key components, integration points, and testing strategy
5. **Start implementing** once we've discussed and agreed on the approach
