I have written the following prompt for LLM agent in order to deep research a specific task for me. Try to figure out what exactly I want to have done and write a more clear and more concise prompt that I can give to the deep research LLM.

I want you to research how to create an optimal set up to work with AI agents in cursor. I am building flutter applications. I want you to figure out how to best right prompts as well as marked down files that give instructions to agents go into detail on how to create architectural guidelines that are optimized to be read by agents figure out the optimal length for these prompts. analyze whether shorter, concise instructions or or very detailed instructions are superior. investigate whether instructions or examples of code or a combination of both are superior. Investigate whether the cold examples are better given as short snippets as part of the markdown files or as a fully complete feature folder in code. figure out which types of instructions should be given as general context for the agent and how you would group or organize these instructions in markdown files consider things like folder, structure of the project architectural choices, such as MVVM as well as preferred packages, usages of these packages for features (eg. riverpod for statemanagement, written in a specific consistent syntax) as well as naming conventions.
in an additional step, create a prompt that I could give to a LNM in order to create those kind of instructions for me. To clarify this task is about writing the instructions on how to write the instructions.
